    "# GET Method:\n",
    "'''Purpose: The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource.\n",
    "Data Transmission: Data is appended to the URL in the form of parameters. This means that the data is visible in the URL and can be bookmarked or cached.\n",
    "Security: Not suitable for sensitive data because data is visible in the URL.\n",
    "Data Length: Limited by the maximum length a URL can handle, typically around 2048 characters.\n",
    "Idempotent: Yes, making the same GET request multiple times will produce the same result.\n",
    "Caching: Can be cached by browsers.'''\n",

    "'''Purpose: The POST method is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource.\n",
    "Data Transmission: Data is sent in the body of the HTTP request, not visible in the URL.\n",
    "Security: More secure for sensitive data as it is not visible in the URL.\n",
    "Data Length: Not limited by the length of the URL, so it can handle large amounts of data.\n",
    "Idempotent: Not necessarily. Making the same POST request multiple times may have different effects, especially if the server state changes with each request.\n",
    "Caching: Generally not cached by browsers (although response might be cacheable under certain conditions).'''\n",
